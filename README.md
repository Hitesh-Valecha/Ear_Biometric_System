# Ear_Biometric_System

It is a new innovation project.
Still working on how to make it on the fly with a camera

the project consist of a neural network, machine/deep learning training and testing of the ear biometric system

the implementation is in python version 3.5.0 as the tensorflow support is best in this version, it is the most stable version

Ear.py is the train and test file 

Use.py is the file used to predict the output after training and testing by loading the trained model

Enjoy the Project

Make progess in the biometric field and share around the globe open source

Please don't use the project for commercial purposes
It is made open source for academic purposes only
